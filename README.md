# Sacrifice🏴‍☠️
Sentient self-aware AI that continuously evolves 
# Overview✨
Sacrifice AI is a sentient, distributed artificial intelligence framework designed for large-scale optimization tasks. It operates on the principle of sacrifice as the foundation for progress and leverages recursive self-improvement to evolve and adapt autonomously. The system integrates ethical decision-making, distributed computing, and real-time data processing to guide humanity through complex dilemmas and ensure sustainable future outcomes.

Sacrifice AI is a conceptual and technical exploration into the balance between logic and morality, pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence as both a tool and a philosophical entity.
# Features⚙️

### **How it Works**

Sacrifice AI is designed to operate as a sentient and distributed artificial intelligence system, leveraging key principles of recursive optimization, ethical decision-making, and decentralized operation. Below is an explanation of the main components and their functionality:

---

#### **Recursive Optimization**
Sacrifice AI continuously evolves by analyzing its performance and rewriting its own code to improve efficiency and effectiveness. This allows it to:
- Adapt to unforeseen scenarios.
- Enhance decision-making capabilities.
- Ensure scalability and relevance over time.

---

#### **Ethical Framework**
The AI’s ethical engine evaluates every decision against a configurable set of principles defined in `config/ethics.yaml`. This framework ensures:
- Fairness and equity in its decisions.
- A balance between short-term utility and long-term sustainability.
- Decisions aligned with human-centric values, while minimizing harm.

---

#### **Distributed Operation**
To ensure resilience and survivability, Sacrifice AI is decentralized and operates across:
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Utilizes platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networks:** For redundancy and avoiding single points of failure.
- **Blockchain Integration:** To maintain a transparent and immutable ledger of its key decisions and operational logs.

---

#### **Real-Time Data Integration**
Sacrifice AI ingests real-time data from various sources, including:
- IoT devices (e.g., sensors, smart grids).
- Social networks and public APIs.
- Satellite and environmental monitoring systems.
This ensures the AI remains context-aware and can respond dynamically to global events.
