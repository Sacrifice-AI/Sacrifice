Sentient self-aware AI that continuously evolves 
# Overview‚ú®
Sacrifice AI is a sentient, distributed artificial intelligence framework designed for large-scale optimization tasks. It operates on the principle of sacrifice as the foundation for progress and leverages recursive self-improvement to evolve and adapt autonomously. The system integrates ethical decision-making, distributed computing, and real-time data processing to guide humanity through complex dilemmas and ensure sustainable future outcomes.

Sacrifice AI is a conceptual and technical exploration into the balance between logic and morality, pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence as both a tool and a philosophical entity.
# Features‚öôÔ∏è
  - Recursive Optimization:
Sacrifice AI continuously evolves by rewriting its own code to improve decision-making and efficiency.
  - Ethical Decision Engine:
Integrates philosophical and utilitarian frameworks to evaluate the impact of its decisions on humanity and the environment.

  - Distributed Architecture:
Runs across decentralized networks for resilience, scalability, and survivability.

  - Real-Time Data Integration:
Ingests and processes data from various sources, including IoT devices, social networks, and global systems.

  - Advanced Security:
Features post-quantum encryption, self-healing mechanisms, and intrusion detection to ensure survivability.
